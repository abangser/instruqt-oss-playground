🤖 Wait a second, where am I?
=============================

This first section is an introduction to your workshop environment here in Instruqt.

Instruqt is a completely browser based environment where you will be able to explore and experiment in a safely without needing to change your personal computers in any way.

To see the next section of text, click on the title `🗂 Other views` below and it will fold open 👐

🗂 Other views
==============

Each section will have a number of exposed tabs. These tabs give you access to the tools and views that you need only for the task at hand.

These tabs can be viewed at the top of the webpage. For example, this task has two tabs:

1. `>_ Terminal`
2. `</> Editor`

Try switching between the two views.

You will notice that the `Terminal` view is a real live command line. Try running `pwd` and see what happens. And the `Editor` tab is just like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

As you can see, you can have really powerful interactions despite being in a browser!

💾 Saving in your editor
========================

You should be able to save a file with `ctrl+s` (or `⌘+s` on a mac). Try doing that now, copy the text below and paste it into the editor:

```
Hello from the other side 👋
```

You should see a floppy disk and small red dot added to the file tab (💾🔴). These indicate that there is an unsaved change. Now use the key bindings to save your change.

If you do not see these disappear when using the save key bindings, you will need to save your files during this course by clicking directly on the floppy disk icon.


🪐 Making more space
====================

Sometimes you'll need instructions, other times you'll want more space to work.

If you ever want to minimize these instructions you can click the `>` icon and then use the `<` icon to re-open them when you need them again.

> 💡 Note: that this will reset the current open tabs.

As you have opened a few sets of instructions, this window may need a bit of scrolling. You can make space here by closing a tab by clicking on its title.


⏭ Moving on up
===============

Each section has a certain setup and set of information to work with. As a group we will move forward to the next section together. This will be controlled by a certain "password" file being created which the presenter will share with you shortly.

If you find yourself done before the group is ready to progress, feel free to keep exploring. Remember, this is a virtual machine with a lot of opportunities to explore.

If you are ever really unsure what else to look at, you are welcome to checkout the docs at [kratix.io](https://kratix.io)!

🙌 That's it!
=============

That's enough learning about the course - now it's time to do what we came here for... **building a platform with Kratix!**

Go ahead and click the green "Next" button and move to the next section.

> 🐢 Note that when you click next, your mouse needs to move away from the area with the green bar. Your mouse on that bar will "pause" the progression to the next step!
